# Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision---CIFAR10
AI techniques were applied to effectively classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset using a custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach significantly enhanced the model's ability to distinguish between 10 distinct object categories, demonstrating the power of AI in handling complex visual data.
